# Gamecraft
Gamecraft is a voxel engine written in C++. It is primarily intended to be a learning project, though I hope to have a fully functioning quality game eventually.

The game is inspired by voxel engines such as Minecraft and Eden: World Builder. It will be focused on building interactive, game-like worlds that can be uploaded and shared with others.

Current features:
- Basic world generation (grassy, flat, snow)
- Collision
- Rain
- Ice with sliding
- World editing
- Region saving/loading
- Audio with XAudio2
- Multithreaded work queue
- Antialiasing
- OpenGL Renderer

Target OS: Windows 10
