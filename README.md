# Gamecraft
Gamecraft is a voxel engine written in C++ with C style. It is primarily intended to be a learning project, though I hope to have a fully functioning quality game in the future.

The game is inspired by voxel engines such as Minecraft and Eden: World Builder. It will be focused on building interactive, game-like worlds that can be uploaded and shared with others.
